Storage of different test db builds using mySQL

NFL_db has two tables, one with player information and one with running back stats by game from the last several years.
The records were downloaded from a kaggle test csv and formatted for insertion into the mySQL db. The data can then be
used to calculate Fantasy points per game/season or vs. specific teams and many other insights.
